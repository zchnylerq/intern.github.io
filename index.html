                <h3>Training Experience</h3>
                <p>Front-end development is not my area of expertise because 
                    I lack creativity. However, I'm quite intrigued by what 
                    I might discover along the way. I've never taken part in 
                    this kind of online group training before, and even though 
                    we've only been working together for a short while, I'm 
                    astounded at how much I've already learned. May we each gain 
                    more knowledge and impart it to others.

                <h4>Feedback</h4>
                <p>He is a strict but considerate leader and trainer. 
                    To be honest, sometimes I'm a bit confused by what 
                    he says but he makes an effort to communicate and 
                    teach us a lesson.</p>

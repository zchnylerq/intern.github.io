                <p>My name is Greleen Perez, 19 years of age. I'm currently a 2nd-year BS Computer Science student at Silliman University.
                    Computer Science degree was never been an option since I was a child until highschool, though, I don't have specific in mind. 
                    However, during pandemic, I became addicted with cryptography so I looked into what courses I could take relating to it 
                    and came across Computer Science. Even though they are not directly related, I became interested in this course. Aside from that, 
                    solving logical math problems offers me thrill and satisfaction, thus here I am.
                </p>
                <p>Front-end development is not my area of expertise because I lack creativity. However, I'm quite intrigued by what I might discover 
                    along the way. I've never taken part in this kind of online group training before, and I can say that this a perfect opportunity 
                    for me which I can hone and discover more skills. 
                </p>
